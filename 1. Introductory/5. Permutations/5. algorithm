start:
    Take n as input
    Take an empty queue q
    Iterate i from 1 to n:
        if i is odd add i to the answer list
        else push i into queue q
    Iterate for every element in the queue:
        Get the front element 
        size <- size of answer list
        difference <- absolute difference between front and last_element_of_answer_list
        if there is no last element or difference greater than 1
            add front into the anser list
            pop front from queue
        else :
            Print "NO SOLUTION"
            goto end
    print the anser list
