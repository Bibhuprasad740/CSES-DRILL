start:
    Take t as input
    Take t queries as input
    for every query in the queries do: 

        Go to n * n square (where n is max of row and col)
            find the corner value by the formula (n * n - 1) + 1
        
        if row equals column, corner value is the answer for this query, so add corner value to the answer list
        else if row is smaller than n
            if n is even,
                largest number starts from the left of that row, so decrement the corner value by n - row times 
            otherwise 
                largest number starts from the top of that column, so increment the corner value by n - row times
        else if col is smaller
            if n is even,
                largest number starts from the left of that row, so increment the corner value by n - col times 
            otherwise 
                largest number starts from the top of that column, so decrement the corner value by n - col times
        add corner value to the answer list
        
    5. return answer list;
